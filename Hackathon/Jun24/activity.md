# Tinker Coder
## Lesson 7.6.2
### Welcome!

In this lesson, you will learn about the basics of redstone.

For more instructions, go to Lesson 6 in your book. Be sure to read all the instructions.

<sub>*No coding is required for this activity. If you are found to be using other blocks, trying to get around the controls of the map, or building yourself, the map will be reset and you will have to start over. No extra time will be given in these cases.*</sub>
