## Hackathon
### Welcome!

Welcome to the Hackathon! Before you start, be sure to listen to your instructors as they give out instructions.

<sub>*You must only use the blocks given here. If you are found to be using other blocks, trying to get around the controls of the map, or building yourself, the map will be reset and you will have to start over. No extra time will be given in these cases.*</sub>
