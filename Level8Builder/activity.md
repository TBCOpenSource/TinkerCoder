# Tinker Coder
## Level 8 
### Welcome!

Welcome to Level 8! In this level, you will be putting everything you have learned so far to build your very own maps. You should have already read through the instructions for your current lesson and looked at the sample worlds provided to you as inspiration. Feel free to ask your instructor to help you with more research if you need it. 

As you code, make sure you DO NOT delete any of the code that you have successfully used. At the end of the lesson, you can show off what you have built, and your code to your parent/guardian.

<sub>*You must only use the blocks given here. If you are found to be using other blocks, trying to get around the controls of the map, or building yourself, the map will be reset and you will have to start over. No extra time will be given in these cases.*</sub>
