### Welcome!

You are seeing this because you're in a world meant for you to explore and take inspiration before building one of your own. No coding is required in this map. Don't spend too long looking around as you need ample time to build. Feel free to save and return to this map if you need to.

<sub>*You must only use the blocks given here. If you are found to be using other blocks, trying to get around the controls of the map, or building yourself, the map will be reset and you will have to start over. No extra time will be given in these cases.*</sub>
